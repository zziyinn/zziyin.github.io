I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in [Information Science](https://sils.unc.edu/master-of-science-in-information-science-msis/) at the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at UNC-Chapel Hill. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Business from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK.

**At the crossroads of business and data modeling, with unstoppable passion, I translate information into actionable insights, empowering innovation and driving growth.**

As a data analyst with a business foundation, I have the best of both worlds. I think strategically about data analysis and understand how data aligns with business objectives. Additionally, I have the ability to translate complex technical findings into actionable business insights, and looking forward, my goal is to utilize my unique skill set to help companies make smarter data-driven decisions that drive growth and success.


**TECHNICAL SKILLS**

Languages: Python, R, SQL, SAS, JavaScript, AMPL, Java
Developer Tools: VS Code, Jupyter, Git, Linux, GitHub, R-Studio, MATLAB, Tableau
Platforms: PyTorch, Tensorflow, Hadoop, Spark, DBeaver, PostgreSQL, AWS
Modeling & Algorithms: Data Structures, Linear/Convex Optimization, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM


**My Projects**

* **Generative Models of Brain Connectomes under Neurological Diseases**: 
  - Network Diffusion Constrained Variational Generative Models: Under Reviews!
  - Score-based Stochastic Network Diffusion Models for Connectomes Dyanmics under Neuodegeneration

* **Optimization Algorithms and Graph Theory**
  - Robust Steiner-Tree Temporal Reconstruction of Network Diffusion Processes under Online Noise: Under Reviews!

* **Physics-constrained Machine Learning**
  - Representative Deep-Gray Themodynamic Models of Residenital Buildings: ([Energy & Buildings 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778824005243))

Off the main stem, I also explored these topics:  

* **Augmenting Bayesian Topic Models using Online Confirmation from Community-driven Apps**: ([BuildSys 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600100.3626341))

* **Empirical WiFi Datasets for Localizing Covid-19 Intervention**: ([Front. in Digital Health 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1060828/full))

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, a reader, and an audience of musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
