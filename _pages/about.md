I am currently a Ph.D. student in the interdisciplinary [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell) from the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics. Previously, I earned my M.S. in the same major under the joint supervision of [Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/) and [Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/), focusing on WiFi networks, mobility data, and Covid-19 models. I also completed internships at [Tesla](https://tesla.com/), working on the networking planning of superchargers, and at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), working on large-scale representative thermodynamic models.

My academic background includes studies in Economics and Mathematics, leading to the attainment of my BS from Presbyterian College, SC, United States.

A key focus of my Ph.D. research is the examination of the dynamics involved in various social, physical, and pathological processes. These dynamics can be understood as networks and perturbations, which play crucial roles. These networks can represent diverse connections, including those that are online, sparse or expensive to approximate and maintain. I am particularly interested in exploring whether it is possible to reverse-engineer a model that simulates real-world processes on these networks in order to complete the networks, re-establish their progression, or generate new data. This area of research continues to be a significant focus of my Ph.D. program.


<span style="color: red"> Our lab will hire one master or bachelor student as a short-term research assistant for the project of Score-based Network Diffusion Models for Connectomes Dynamics under Neurodegeneration for Spring 2025. Please see the [job description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LP-zkn3ZYpa--gsa2nxP8a6LTyTPWJOMLnEie77xCfI/edit) and drop me an email if you are interested.   </span>

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, a reader, and an audience of musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
