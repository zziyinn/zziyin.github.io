**For perosonal: information gap worth everything!**

**How I started my journey:**

My journey began in the field of business. As I gained **insight** into how companies operate and how **management** **decisions** affect performance. I quickly realized that many decisions were not just based on intuition or experience, but also on insights gained from **data** and **analytics**.

While working as an analyst intern, I began to see the great potential of data. **Not only could data explain past trends, but it could also predict future outcomes**. I realized that data analytics can provide more accurate decision support than traditional business analysis. It can uncover hidden opportunities, optimize processes, and even enhance the customer experience. This realization led to my decision to move from a **business-centric to a data-centric career**.

To further develop my data analytics skills, I pursued a master's degree in **information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**. There, I immersed myself in advanced technologies such as machine learning, database development, and natural language processing. In addition to mastering these technical tools, **my business background gives me a unique perspective - I can understand the real-world needs and challenges companies face when it comes to data analytics.**

As a data analyst with a business foundation, I have the best of both worlds. I think strategically about data analysis and understand how data aligns with business objectives. Additionally, I have the ability to translate complex technical findings into actionable business insights, and looking forward, **my goal is to utilize my unique skill set to help companies make smarter data-driven decisions that drive growth and success.**
